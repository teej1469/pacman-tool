# pacman-tool

Simple python tool I'm working on that essentially acts as a bulk Pacman package manipulation tool.
I wrote this cuz I got tired of manually searching and deleting all packages related to PipeWire for
reinstallation.

## TODO:

* [X] Bulk package removal
* [X] Package resyncing
* [ ] Full system update/upgrade on dry run (Like`yay`)
* [ ] (Maybe) AUR support
